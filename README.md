# TDD TS Docker Starter Kit

Starter kit for new Node-based back-end projects.

Opinions:
- Node for app development 
- Express for RESTful endpoints 
  CAVEAT: This is a starter for microservices. GraphQL is superior for client-facing APIs
- TypeScript for type safety and optimal DX
- Docker for deployment and dev/prod parity
